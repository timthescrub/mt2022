    "**A pedestrian history-of-thought background.** In the late 1980s through to the 2000s, business cycle modellers and central-bank economists wanted to have models that could provide microeconomic-based narratives of monetary policy and the business cycle. The concern was largely in response to Lucas' famous critique of doing economic policy based on reduced-form estimates of empirical relationships (e.g., the Phillips curve relationship).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the dominant paradigm at the time was the New Classical, real-business-cycle approach. The RBC models (including those with money hacked into them using, e.g., the CIA approach) lacked the ability to rationalize short-run monetary policy and its effects on inflation and the business cycle. A paper by Tack Yun and also work by Julio Rotemberg provided two templates that \"reconciled\" the New Classical's approach to business cycles (Walrasian price theory and rational expectations) with a somewhat Hicksian understanding of Keynes' *General Theory*. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Later, this was popularized in tomes like Woodford's *Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy*. (Woodford's book title was a riff off the classic Don Patinkin book *Money, Interest, and Prices*. For Woodford, \"money\" was noticeable dropped from the title and subtly swept under the modeller's proverbial rug of logical-consistency stains. This was because the notion of money having value (or the notion of equilibrium asset liquidity) remained \"an embarrasment\" to the classical microeconomics of general-equilibrium or price theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tack rewrote Calvo's continuous-time pricing model with random Poisson price-update shocks into a discrete-time, CIA-RBC model. Rotemberg assumes that firms face some convex cost of adjusting prices. Either approach delivered the desired implication that, in equilibrium, prices do not adjust instantaneously to demand- or supply-side shocks. With these simple parametric restrictions that are either behavioral (the Calvo-Yun approach) or technological (the Rotemberg approach), economists could now have a tractable, general-equilibrium narrative that provides a rationale for monetary policy and its effects on the real economy through either money-stock or interest rate control. In short order, the New Keynesian model was essential and RBC model with an assumed price-adjustment friction on the firms'- or supply-side of the economy. One might still wonder though, wherein lies the microfoundation for random or costly price adjustments (the absence of which would render monetary policy neutral)?\n",
